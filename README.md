## Valid commands
### Create team
`/criar-equipa [team name]`
Creates a new team, if the name doesn't exists already.  Returns the newly created team information: The name, ID and a access key, which allows users to enter the team using that code. Reports an error stating that a team cannot be created if something fails. If the team name already exists the team isn't created and an error message appears in the chat.
### Join team
`/entrar [entry-code]`

### Buy
`/compra [@destination_user] [qty] [description]`
