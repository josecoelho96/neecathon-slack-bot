A slack bot for the NEECathon!

## Valid commands
### Create team
`/criar-equipa [team name]`
Creates a new team, if the name doesn't exists already.  Returns the newly created team information: The name, ID and a access key, which allows users to enter the team using that code. Reports an error stating that a team cannot be created if something fails. If the team name already exists the team isn't created and an error message appears in the chat.
### Join team
`/entrar [entry-code]`
Joins the team with the defined `entry-code`, if exists. If the `entry-code` is valid, the user receives a message and joins the team. If it's invalid, an error message pops up.
### Balance check
`/saldo`
Shows the team-wise current balance. If the user does not have a team, an error message appears stating how to join a team.
### Buy
`/compra [@destination_user] [qty] [description]`
Allows to buy something from another user. It performs a transfer, between the command caller and the `destination_user`, by giving him `qty` credits. A short description must be provided to describe the transaction. If `destination_user` isn't enrolled in a team, an error message will be displayed stating that. If `qty` is invalid (unparsable, negative, null or above team actual balance), the user will get an error message explaining the problem.
### List last transactions
`/movimentos <qty>`
List transactions. If the user has a team, list the last `qty` transactions of his team. If the current user doesn't have a team, an error message appears stating how to join a team.
