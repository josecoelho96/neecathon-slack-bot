# neecathon-slack-bot
A slack bot for the NEECathon!

## Deployment instructions
### Server side
1. Clone repository into server/machine: \
    `git clone <url>`
2. Change directory into the `deployment` directory: \
    `cd neeacthon-slack-bot/deployment`
3. Set `server_setup.sh` script as executable: \
    `chmod +x server_setup.sh`
4. Run script (might need sudo privileges): \
    `./server_setup.sh`
5. On the repository root (`neecathon-slack-bot`), run: \
    `python3 deployment/app_setup.py` \
This will create the env file and create all channels/groups needed.
6. Execute the command: \
    `docker-compose up -d`
7. The docker-compose should be running and a message should have been posted on the logs channel. If not, please check the logs to detect the errors.
8. Do one (any) request with the admin account. It will fail, but don't worry.
9. On the terminal, type: \
    `docker exec -ti <database-container-name> psql --username=<db-user-name> <db-name>` \
    Eg: `docker exec -ti neecathon-db psql --username=neecathon-bot-db-user neecathon-bot-db`

10. Now type the following on the `psql` prompt: \
    `\c database_name` (Example: `\c neecathon-bot-db`)
11. Type: \
    ` SELECT * FROM users;` which should give you one row with the user id of the admin account.
12. Type: \
    ` INSERT INTO permissions(user_id, staff_function) VALUES ('<user-id>', 'admin');`
13. The user should now be an admin.

### Slack side
1. Create new user, and setup the profile (full name, display name, user details, user photo). This user will be used to generate the token and must have full access to the repository.
2. Change settings of the workspace:
    1. **Workspace Signup Mode:** *Invitation only*
    2. **Workspace Icon:** *If desired*
3. Create new application:
    1. Setup *App Name*, *Short Description* and *App Icon*.
    2. On *OAuth & Permissions*, add the required scopes:
        1. Modify your public channels -  channels:write
        2. Send messages as NEECathon App - chat:write:bot
        3. Modify your private channels -  groups:write
    3. On the same tab, publish the application and save the OAuth Access Token on the .env file.
4. Add all slash commands. Never forget to enable 'Escape Names'.

## Valid commands
### Create team
